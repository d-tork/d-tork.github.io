The VHP is working slowly through their backlog of videos, and could not say when the video would
be published on their site (https://www.loc.gov/vets). However, their policy allows for one gratis
copy to be provided to the veteran's immediate family. 

Until they publish it themselves I have stored a copy in my public OneDrive folder for anyone to 
watch or download, [here](https://1drv.ms/v/s!Av8_aX-AmG8xl_ZAzF-0Cfy74dFI1Q).
